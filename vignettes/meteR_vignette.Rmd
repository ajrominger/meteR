#Introduction
The package meteR is designed to facilitate fitting the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) from data. For an overview of METE, see Harte et al. (2008), Harte (2011), and Harte and Newman (2014). Note that throughout this tutorial we use the notation for quantities used by the theory from these sources without extensive explanation. `meteR` can use data input in multiple formats and predict all the fundamental distributions of the theory (see Figure 1). Our objective is to facilitate tests of METE with empirical data sets.

#Case Study 1 - Abundance and Power Distributions
We begin illustrating the capabilities of `meteR` with data from an arthropod community (data ref; more info). This data is distributed as part of `meteR`. We will use it to illustrate the construction of distributions related to abundance and energy. Notably, these data do not contain any spatial information so we illustrate spatial predictions with a different data set in the next section.

```{r}
library(meteR)
data(arth)
dim(arth)
head(arth)
```
This data set illustrates one data format used by `meteR`; each row represents an individual, with an observation of its metabolic rate (note that we convert mass to metabolic rate using the usual relationship of Metabolic Scaling Theory such that metabolic rate=mass^(3/4)).If multiple individuals of the same size are observed, these can be specified as well (i.e., `arth$count` is something other than 1.) See the data set `anbo`, included with  `meteR`, discussed in the next section. There are two main reasons to provide data to `meteR`: (1) `meteR` will calculate the state variables (N (# individuals), S (# species), E (total metabolic rate), A (total area)) and relevant summary statistics for you; (2) these data are used by `meter` to compare against predictions. If data are not provided, the values for the state variables can be directly specified by the user (see Case Study 3).

Analysis begins by building the ecosystem structure function (ESF; R(n,e)). 
```{r}
esf1=meteESF(spp=arth$spp,
            abund=arth$count,
            power=arth$mass^(3/4),
            minE=min(arth$mass^(3/4)))
esf1
str(esf1)
```
The structure of the ESF contains some useful information. In addition to returning the inputs (in analogy, e.g., to common model fitting functions such as lm()), it returns the Lagrange multipliers as well as information about the fitting procedure. Note that we specified the mininmum value for the metabolic rate, but that the minimum observed value will be taken by default. <!-- explain mine? -->
<!-- To fit the model, `meteESF` uses...explain the algorithm briefly and when it should work -->

## SAD
From the ESF, we can predict macroecological patterns. We begin with the species abundance distribution (SAD).
```{r}
sad1=sad.meteESF(esf1)
sad1
```
`sad.meteESF` fits the SAD and provides density (d), distribution function (p), quantile function (q), and random generation (r) for the distribution (see these with `str(sad1)`. This specification follows the conventions used by commonly used statistical distributions in the `stats` package (e.g. see `?rnorm`). These distributions allow us to use the model in a number of ways. You can access these directly as follows; e.g. randomly generating samples from the fitted distribution or determining the quantiles.
```{r}
sad1$r(20)
sad1$q(seq(0,1,length=10))
```
`meteR` readily plots the SAD (and other predicted distributions):
```{r fig.width=7, fig.cap="Different ways of plotting the IPD"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(sad1, ptype='rad')
plot(sad1, ptype='cdf')
```

We provide functions to assess model fit based on likelihood and residuals. First, we illustrate likelihood methods:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Likelihood-based z-score."}
#== calculate the liklihood of the data, given the fitted model
logLik(sad1)
#== randomly generate 100 data sets from the fitted distribution and calculate
#== the z-score of the data w.r.t. these simulations
llz=logLikZ.meteDist(sad1, nrep=100, return.sim=TRUE)
llz$z
#== plot the distributions
plot(density(llz$sim),
     xlim=range(c(llz$sim,llz$obs)),
     xlab='log(likelihood)',col='red')
abline(v=llz$obs,lty=2)
legend('top',legend=c('data','simulated\nfrom METE'),
       col=c('black','red'), lty=c(1,1),bty='n') 
```
Note that other utilities that extract liklihoods from model objects are also useful:

```{r}
AIC(sad1)
```

Next, we illustrate methods relying on residuals.

```{r}
#== calculate the residuals from the fitted distribution
head(residuals(sad1))
head(residuals(sad1, type='cumulative', relative=FALSE))
#== calculate the mean-squared error
mse.meteDist(sad1, type='rank', relative=FALSE)
#== randomly generate 100 data sets from the fitted distribution and calculate
#== the z-score of the data w.r.t. these simulations
mseZ.meteDist(sad1, nrep=100,return.sim=TRUE)

```

## IPD

Similarly to the analyses illustrated above for the SAD, one can examine the individual power distribution (IPD; the distribution of metabolic rates over individauls in the community). We illustrate with an abbreviated version of the analyses above. First, fit and plot the IPD.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.cap="Different ways of plotting the IPD"}
ipd1=ipd.meteESF(esf1)
ipd1
str(ipd1) # analogous structure to sad1 above
ipd1$r(8) # random number generation from fitted distribution

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(ipd1, ptype='cdf')
plot(ipd1, ptype='rad')
```

Next, assess the fit of the IPD.

```{r fig.width=5, fig.cap="Likelihood-based z-score."}
head(residuals(ipd1))
logLik(ipd1)
logLikZ.meteDist(ipd1, nrep=100)
(llz=logLikZ.meteDist(ipd1, nrep=100, return.sim=TRUE))
plot(density(llz$sim),xlim=range(c(llz$sim,llz$obs)),xlab='log(likelihood)',col='red')
abline(v=llz$obs,lty=2)
legend('top',legend=c('data','simulated\nfrom METE'),col=c('black','red'),
       lty=c(1,1),bty='n') 

```

Interestingly, although it appears that the data are unlikely to have been drawn from the METE distribution based on the z-score of the likelood, the mean squared error suggests otherwise.

```{r fig.width=5, fig.cap="Mean squared error-based z-score."}
mse.meteDist(ipd1, type='rank', relative=FALSE)
mseZ=mseZ.meteDist(ipd1, nrep=100, return.sim=TRUE)
mseZ$z
plot(density(mseZ$sim),xlim=range(c(mseZ$sim,mseZ$obs)),xlab='mse',col='red')
abline(v=llz$obs,lty=2)
legend('top',legend=c('data','simulated\nfrom METE'),col=c('black','red'),
       lty=c(1,1),bty='n') 
```
<!--discuss residuals vs. likelihoods. arth ipd is supported by residauls z but not liklihood. -->


<!--========================================================================-->
#Case Study 2 - Spatial distributions
Next, we illustrate with data from a desert grassland community known as anza 
borrego (data ref). This data is distributed as part of meteR. We will use it to 
illustrate the construction of distributions related to abundance and area. Note that metabolic rate/body mass information are not available, but that we can still analyze many of METE's predictions. 
```{r}
data(anbo)
head(anbo)
```
As shown in case study 1 above, we can build the ESF and investigate the SAD.
```{r}
data(anbo)
head(anbo)

esf2=meteESF(spp=anbo$spp,
              abund=anbo$count)
str(esf2)
#sad2=sad.meteESF(esf2)
#sad2
```
Note that when metabolic rate data are absent, meteR assumes a very large value for the state variable E0, such that terms involiving E0 can be safely ignored in distriutions and relationships involving abundance.

```{r,fig.width=7}
#sad=sad.meteESF(esf1)
#par(mfrow=c(1,2))

```

<!--========================================================================-->
# Case Study 3 - Specifying the state variables
`meteR` allows the user to manually specify the state variables, which can be useful to buld models from data structures not accomodated by `meteR` or to explore how METE predictions vary as a function of state variables.

```{r,fig.width=7}
esf3=meteESF(N0=4000,S0=50,E0=1e5,minE=1)
sad3=sad.meteESF(esf3)
ipd3=ipd.meteESF(esf3)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(sad3)
plot(ipd3)
```
